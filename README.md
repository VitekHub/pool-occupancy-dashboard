## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Configure your environment variables (see Configuration section below)
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `VITE_POOL_OCCUPANCY_CONFIG_URL` | URL to the pool configuration JSON file |
| `VITE_BASE_OCCUPANCY_CSV_URL` | Base URL for occupancy CSV data files |
| `VITE_MAX_CAPACITY_CSV_URL` | URL to the maximum capacity CSV data |
| `VITE_WEEK_CAPACITY_CSV_URL` | URL to the weekly capacity CSV data |

### Pool Configuration

The application loads pool configurations from a JSON file specified in `VITE_POOL_OCCUPANCY_CONFIG_URL`. Each pool can have both inside and outside facilities:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Pool Name",
    "insidePool": {
      "customName": "Indoor Pool",
      "url": "https://pool-website.com",
      "pattern": "data-pattern",
      "csvFile": "indoor_occupancy.csv",
      "maximumCapacity": 50,
      "totalLanes": 6,
      "weekdaysOpeningHours": "6:00-21:00",
      "weekendOpeningHours": "8:00-20:00",
      "collectStats": true,
      "viewStats": true,
      "temporarilyClosed": "1.1.2024 - 15.1.2024"
    },
    "outsidePool": {
      "customName": "Outdoor Pool",
      "url": "https://pool-website.com",
      "pattern": "data-pattern",
      "csvFile": "outdoor_occupancy.csv",
      "maximumCapacity": 100,
      "weekdaysOpeningHours": "6:00-21:00",
      "weekendOpeningHours": "8:00-20:00",
      "collectStats": true,
      "viewStats": true
    }
  }
]
```

## Data Sources

The application works with three types of CSV data files:

1. **Pool Occupancy Data** (`pool_occupancy.csv`):
   ```
   Date,Day,Time,Occupancy
   01.01.2024,Monday,08:00:00,15
   ```

2. **Maximum Capacity Data** (`capacity.csv`):
   ```
   Date,Day,Hour,Maximum Occupancy
   01.01.2024,Monday,8,45
   ```

3. **Weekly Capacity Data** (`week_capacity.csv`):
   ```
   Date,Day,Hour,Maximum Occupancy
   01.01.2024,Monday,8,45
   ```

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.
